Head first Javascripts programming by Eric Freeman
JavaScript gives you superpowers. The true programming language of the web, JavaScript lets you add behavior to your web pages. No more dry, boring, static pages that just sit there looking at you—with JavaScript, you’ll be able to reach out and touch your users, react to interesting events, grab data from the web to use in your pages, draw graphics right into those pages, and a lot more. And once you know JavaScript, you’ll also be in a position to create totally new behaviors for your users.
